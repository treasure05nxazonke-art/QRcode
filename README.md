📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

How to structure content using semantic HTML elements like <main>, <figure>, and <figcaption>

How to center elements both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox

How to style cards using border-radius, background-color, and overflow: hidden

How to make images responsive using max-width and height: auto

⚠️ Challenges Faced

I faced a few challenges while working on this project:

Padding:
I struggled to balance padding so that the content looked neat without making the card too large or too small.

Min-width and Max-width:
Understanding how min-width, max-width, and fixed widths interact took some trial and error. Sometimes the container did not resize the way I expected.

Max-height:
I had issues controlling the height of the container, especially when combining max-height with flexible content like text and images.

I solved these problems by testing different values, using browser developer tools, and learning how Flexbox affects layout behavior.

🚀 Future Improvements

Improve responsiveness for very small and very large screens

Clean up spacing and typography for better visual balance

Add hover or focus states for accessibility
